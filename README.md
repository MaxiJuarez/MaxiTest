Since I've coded this on a Windows pc the test will work by default on Windows and it has chrome driver included on the /driver folder of the project.

The default folder for the project is: "C:\automation\MaxiTest\MaxiTest"

Go to the BaseTest class and Change the config if you want to use another OS/driver/folder.

I could have configured this mini-framework with more complexity, like sending parameters through TestNG XML and create the driver accordingly depending on OS, etc, on the local computer or to execute on some cloud service (such as browserstack) but I was told to keep it simple and not consume more than 5 hs. So I didn't include any desired capabilities either.

If needed, I can use Rest Assured for Endpoints/API tests and SQL for performing queries on Databases.
I also know how to execute mobile tests on Appium for both iOS and Android (on local device, simulator/emulator, or execution on browserstack).
I have created and configured automation frameworks from scratch that include FE testing (web and mobile apps) and BE testing (APIs and DBs).
I have worked with developers to configure the FastLane plugin to automatically upload builds to browserstack under certain Test ID's so that I can execute tests on the latest alpha/beta builds.
